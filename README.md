Independent CS projects in Java and Python

Bidder.py and Auction.py 

Python program that implements Professor Matthew Weinberg’s low regret algorithms and uses machine learning to calculate the price at which a bidder should bid at in different types of auction scenarios to secure his lowest regret. Other applications of these algorithms could include credit scoring and price determination. The program uses Seaborn to visualize the results. 

Genome.java

Java program that parses a file of DNA into 100 sequence reads and then assembles a genome by identifying the strings that don't belong in the genome, removing them and calculating the overlap between the prefixes and suffixes of the remaining strings. 

BarcodeErrorCorrection.java (coming soon)

Java program that implements a new motif-finding algorithm to identify and error-correct DNA barcode tags used in single cell sequencing. The algorithm uses k-words (sequence used for sequence alignment) with an associated set of neighborhoods in the set of all k-letter words to identify a ‘consensus’ barcode by building hash tables to identify and record the number of substitution error mutations and shifting the barcode strings to identify deletion errors.
